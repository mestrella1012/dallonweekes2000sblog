  <p> This tall glass of water is Dallon James Weekes, born May 4, 1981. He is such a dad. So  talented. A blade of grass. Dallon Weekes is the best bass player ever the man is so talented. He plays other instruments such as vocals (yes vocals is an instrument), piano, keyboards, synthesizers, ukulele, and guitar. Such talent T_T. He did not put his gifts to waste, and as a hobby started the band "The Brobecks." Amazing band please listen. From 2002-2013, "The Brobecks" blessed us with some bops. Especially "Love at First Sight." I cry every time. During the time he was with "The Brobecks", Dallon hopped on over to Panic! At The Disco, where Brendon  Urie was in desperate need of band members (so sad, Rebecca play fake love). Starting from 2009, Dallon joined Panic as the bass player. At first he was just a touring  member but then asked to be an official band member. In 2011 he created the concept art for the album "Vices and Virtues" (give it a listen it's a masterpiece). Dallon assisted in the writing of several songs on Panic's 2013 album "Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die!" (also a masterpeice please listen).

<p>Continuing on, Dallon has solo songs that are just so good. What a good morman *cry*. Like honestly they are some good Christmas bops. Please listen to them honestly you will be blessed. Dallon's more recent music is his new band "IDK HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME." Suport them they are amazing like please. They have some bops including "Modern Day Cain" and "Choke." Before starting this band with former "Falling In Reverse" drummer Ryan Seaman, he once again became a Panic tour member and then officially left Panic! At The Disco in 2017 (RIP Brendon Urie). Now they have Nicole Row as bassist. She's great buut... DALLON WEEKES. Always Dallon Weekes is my dad and y'all should support him k thanks.
